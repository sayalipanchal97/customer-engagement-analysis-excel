# Customer Engagement Analysis 

### Introduction
This project aims to analyze customer engagement within the 365 company's platform, focusing on the impact of newly introduced features designed to enhance the student experience. In 2022, there were high expectations for the growth of the 365 company and increased student engagement based on the introduction of new website platform features. Some of these features included an XP system that enabled students to track their progress, level up, and earn rewards by completing various learning objectives. The platform also offered in-app coins that could be exchanged for special awards, a leaderboard where students could compete for top positions in different divisions, earning weekly rewards and advancing up the ladder, and streaks to motivate students to maintain consistent learning habits. Additionally, the company expanded its course library, covering a broader range of topics to provide its students with a richer set of skills and attract a larger audience. These enhancements were anticipated to positively impact the student experience, create an effective strategy for customer engagement, and contribute to the company's success in the coming year. This analysis aims to evaluate whether these new additions to the platform have indeed increased student engagement.

### Objectives
- To gain hands-on practice with statistical methods and techniques.
- To analyze the impact of new platform features on student engagement within the 365 company's platform.
- To derive actionable insights that can guide future enhancements and strategies for customer engagement.

### Methodology
The analysis was conducted through the following tasks:

1. Descriptive Statistics:
   To summarize the engagement data of students,
   - Calculated measures of central tendency(mean, median, standard deviation) 
   - Calculated measures of shape (skewness, kurtosis).

2. Confidence Interval:
   - Established a confidence interval for the average engagement time of students, allowing for a better understanding of the variability and reliability of the data.

3. Hypothesis Testing:
   - Performed statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate the impact of the platform's new features to determine whether the platformâ€™s new features contribute to the increase of minutes watched on the platform for both free-plan and paying students,
   - Evaluated whether the average number of minutes watched in the US is similar to that in India, comparing engagement levels across these two regions.
